# ShakitLive Bot - Fixes Summary
**Date:** 2025-10-27
**Session:** Intent Detection & Flow Improvements

---

## üî• CRITICAL ISSUE FIXED

### Problem: Bot stuck in generic FAQ loop
**Symptom:** User asks "what is supercard" or "track order" ‚Üí Bot responds with generic FAQ message instead of triggering specific flows.

**Root Cause:**
1. `matchesSupercard()` included generic "card" keyword that was too broad
2. Gemini AI possibly detecting wrong intent
3. Keyword matching not specific enough

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated `lib/services/intent-detector.ts` line 301-324
- Removed generic "card" keyword
- Made matching more specific and contextual
- Now requires "supercard" OR ("loyalty"/"rewards"/"points" + "shakey's")

---

## ‚úÖ ALL FIXES COMPLETED

### 1. Order Flow - "Skip Drinks/Desserts" Bug ‚úÖ

**Problem:** Bot became unresponsive when users clicked "Skip Drinks" or "Skip Desserts"

**Root Cause:**
- Switch case routed `ASK_DRINKS` to `handleAskDrinks()` which had guard `if (userMessage !== "") return;`
- Guard blocked all button clicks
- Same issue for desserts

**Fix:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (BROKEN)
case "ASK_DRINKS":
  await this.handleAskDrinks(...); // Has guard that returns for non-empty
  break;

// AFTER (FIXED)
case "ASK_DRINKS":
case "SHOW_DRINKS_CAROUSEL":
  await this.handleDrinkSelection(...); // Handles all cases
  break;
```

**Files Modified:**
- `/Users/rahul/ShakitLive Bot/lib/flows/order-flow.ts`

### 2. Quick Replies Implementation ‚úÖ

**Added to Order Flow:**
- Drinks question: ü•§ Add Drinks | ‚è≠Ô∏è Skip
- Desserts question: üç∞ Add Desserts | ‚è≠Ô∏è Skip | ‚úÖ Checkout

**Added to Location Flow:**
- Initial question: ‚úÖ Yes, show me | üìû Call instead | üåê Visit website

**Implementation:**
```typescript
const quickReplies = [
  { content_type: "text" as const, title: "ü•§ Add Drinks", payload: "show_drinks" },
  { content_type: "text" as const, title: "‚è≠Ô∏è Skip", payload: "skip_drinks" }
];

await FacebookService.sendQuickReplies(userSsid, message, quickReplies);
```

---

### 3. Typing Indicators ‚úÖ

**Added to all message sends:**
- 1500ms before questions
- 1000ms before confirmations
- Before all carousels

**Implementation:**
```typescript
await FacebookService.sendTypingIndicator(userSsid, 1500);
await FacebookService.sendQuickReplies(...);
```

---

### 4. Intent Detection Fix ‚úÖ

**Problem:** Generic keywords causing wrong flow detection

**Fix:** Made keyword matching more specific

**Before:**
```typescript
const supercardKeywords = [
  "supercard", "super card", "loyalty", "rewards", "points",
  "membership", "member", "card" // TOO BROAD!
];
```

**After:**
```typescript
const supercardKeywords = [
  "supercard", "super card", "loyalty card", "rewards card",
  "shakey's card", "shakys card", "membership card"
];

// Plus contextual check:
if ((msg.includes("loyalty") || msg.includes("rewards")) &&
    (msg.includes("shakey") || msg.includes("shakys"))) {
  return true;
}
```

complaint          ‚Üí Should trigger Complaint flow (NOT FAQ)
promo              ‚Üí Should trigger Promo flow (NOT FAQ)
```

**Each test should:**
1. Start with "clear conversation"
2. Send test command
3. Verify correct flow triggers
4. Confirm NO generic FAQ message
