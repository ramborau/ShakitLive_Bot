## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Bot keeps showing generic FAQ instead of specific flow

**Root Cause**: Intent detection fallback or Gemini AI failure

**Solution**:
1. Check if hot keywords are present in user message
2. Verify intent-detector.ts keyword matching
3. Check Gemini API key and quota
4. Ensure flow-handler routes intents correctly

### Issue: Flow gets stuck at a step

**Root Cause**: Switch case routing to wrong handler or early return guard

**Solution**:
1. Ensure switch cases route to correct handlers
2. Remove guards that return early for user input
3. Test with both button payloads and text input

### Issue: Quick replies not showing

**Root Cause**: Using sendMixedButtonMessage instead of sendQuickReplies

**Solution**:
1. Replace button templates with quick replies
2. Use FacebookService.sendQuickReplies()
3. Ensure typing indicators are added before messages
