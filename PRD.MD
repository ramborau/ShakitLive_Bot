Facebook Webhook Chat App (SHADCN + NEXT.js + Node.js + React)
TL;DR
Build a modern web app using SHADCN, Next.js, Node.js, and React to serve as a webhook endpoint for Facebook messages from a 3rd-party chatbot. The system processes payloads, enriches messages with user data via MessengerPeople API, stores these chats locally, and presents them in an elegant ShadCN-powered UI. Target audience: product teams needing real-time, archived chat visibility with future extensibility to AI bot support.

Goals
Business Goals
Enable real-time ingestion and storage of Facebook conversations from 3rd-party chatbots.
Offer a reliable, easy-to-use chat UI for internal review and support escalation.
Provide a secure, compliant, and maintainable messaging infrastructure on a modern stack.
User Goals
Instantly see all relevant incoming Facebook chats in an organized interface.
View sender details (name, avatar) on each message for better context.
Quickly search and review message history by thread or user.
Non-Goals
No out-of-the-box AI chatbot/smart-reply capability (yet).
No integration with non-Facebook channels.
No advanced analytics or exports in this MVP.
User Stories
Support Agent:

As a Support Agent, I want to see all messages from Facebook users as live chat threads, so I can respond or escalate promptly.
As a Support Agent, I want the sender’s name and avatar visible, so I know who I’m interacting with.
As a Support Agent, I want chats automatically organized by conversation/thread, so I never lose context.
Admin:

As an Admin, I want to monitor all webhook activity and chat storage, so I can ensure compliance and troubleshooting.
Functional Requirements
Webhook Handling (Priority: High)

Single endpoint receives Facebook payload and validates structure.
Parses each entry, extracting message/user data.
Calls MessengerPeople API to enrich sender info (name, profile picture).
Stores full message + enrichment data in local database, organized by thread/user.
Chat UI (Priority: High)

Responsive chat interface built with ShadCN. Mimics a modern messenger style.
Threads display ordered by latest activity, show sender’s name/avatar.
Message timestamps, error/success indicators.
Data Storage (Priority: High)

Local persistent storage using a simple, reliable database (SQLite or similar for MVP).
Schema includes: user, thread, message, enrichment meta.
Admin/Support Controls (Priority: Medium)

Basic message search/filter by user/thread.
Simple system health/dashboard panel (optional for MVP).
User Experience
Entry Point & First-Time User Experience
Users access the app via a secure login page (or simple public page for MVP). On first visit, they see a clean chat UI, no onboarding friction—just a prompt that chats will appear as messages arrive via the webhook.

Core Experience

Step 1: Facebook triggers the webhook with a user message payload.
Server validates payload, logs receipt.
Step 2: Backend processes the payload, extracts sender ID, calls MessengerPeople API.
Handles API timeouts or malformed responses; falls back to storing minimal info with error logging.
Step 3: Stores the enriched message in the database, associating with correct thread.
Step 4: UI auto-refreshes or pulls new messages into active chat threads.
Displays sender name, photo, message content, timestamp.
Threads with new messages bump to the top.
Step 5: Support user can click on any thread to expand the full conversation.
Advanced Features & Edge Cases

Support for multiple concurrent webhook requests.
Graceful handling of Facebook API payload schema changes (ignore unknown fields).
UI indications for failed enrichment (e.g., display generic avatar/name on error).
UI/UX Highlights

Minimalist, fast-loading interface built on ShadCN + Next.js.
Visible error/success feedback on all actions.
Responsive for mobile/desktop.
Dark mode and accessibility compliant.
Narrative
Imagine Rahul, leading product at a fast-growing team, needs to get visibility into all Facebook messenger conversations from a new chatbot they’re piloting. Right now, there’s no easy way to see, archive, or search these chats outside of the 3rd-party platform—they feel locked out of vital customer context.

With this new webhook app, Rahul’s support agents instantly see every incoming Facebook message—enriched with sender names and photos—presented in a crisp, modern app. No more digging through CSVs, broken exports, or fighting legacy UIs. Support is faster, escalation is easier, and the team feels in control. Once this foundation is in place, Rahul will confidently move forward: building AI bots, extending the product to new channels, and always staying close to the customer.

Success Metrics
User-Centric Metrics
Time to see a new Facebook message in UI: <1 second (P95)
Number of concurrent threads handled without error
Satisfaction rating of support/user team (qualitative feedback)
Business Metrics
% of Facebook messages successfully ingested and displayed (target: >99%)
Reduction in support agent “context lost” escalations
Technical Metrics
Webhook uptime (target: 99.95%)
Message processing latency (goal: <250ms average backend)
Database storage reliability (no data loss/corruption across restarts)
Tracking Plan
Webhook received/processed events
Message enrichment API call success/failure
Thread/message creation and read/display in UI
User search/filter actions
Technical Considerations
Technical Needs
Next.js for frontend SSR and API routes.
Node.js backend to handle webhooks, API calls, storage.
React/SHADCN for fast modern UI.
Local database (SQLite, switchable in future).
Integration Points
Facebook webhook (source)
MessengerPeople API for enrichment
Data Storage & Privacy
All chat/message data stored locally—ensure encryption at rest where needed.
No long-term storage of MessengerPeople tokens/secrets in source control.
Comply with Facebook/Messenger data handling TOS.
Scalability & Performance
Designed for 1–10 support agents, thousands of conversations daily.
App structure should allow scaling out storage/backends if needed later.
Potential Challenges
Handling API token expiry/invalid cases with MessengerPeople.
Fast, reliable UI refresh as new messages arrive (optimistic updates & polling).
Privacy: reviewed/encrypted storage, caution with sensitive user data in logs.
